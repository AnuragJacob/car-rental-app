Web app for car rental service


-- The web application was developed as part of a business ase for a car rental service where users had to first create an account in the app. After doing so, they could access a list of vehicels availble for rent and choose a location to pick up and drop off the vehicle at an office location of their choice. It is stipulated that the vehicle can be picked up and dropped off only at valid office locations, a list of which can be accessed by all users.
-- Other than a user view, an admin view was also created for workers within the rental service so that they could make changes to the list of vehicles, modify customer details, and help in making customer booking. The frontend side of the app was developed using PHP7 and CSS, and the database was based in MySQL (originally developed in Oracle Data Modeler), locally hosted on a platform using Apache. --
